# Complete Social Media Platform – Project Documentation

## 1. Project Overview

### Project Title

**Complete Social Media Platform**

### Description

The Complete Social Media Platform is a full-stack web application built using **Django** and modern web technologies. It allows users to connect socially by creating profiles, sharing posts, liking and commenting on content, sending friend requests, following users, and receiving real-time notifications. The platform also exposes REST APIs for mobile or third-party integrations and supports deployment to cloud platforms.

### Objectives

* Build a real-world, scalable social media application
* Demonstrate strong backend architecture using Django
* Implement social networking features similar to modern platforms
* Provide REST APIs and real-time updates
* Deploy a production-ready application


## 2. Technology Stack

### Backend

* Python 3.x
* Django
* Django REST Framework (DRF)
* Django Channels (WebSockets)

### Frontend

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript

### Database

* SQLite (Development)
* PostgreSQL (Production)

### Other Tools

* Git & GitHub
* Render / Heroku (Deployment)
* Swagger / OpenAPI (API Documentation)


## 3. System Architecture

The application follows a **modular Django architecture**:

* MVC / MVT design pattern
* Separate Django apps for each major feature
* REST APIs for external access
* WebSockets for real-time notifications

### High-Level Flow

1. User sends request via browser or API
2. Django views / DRF views process request
3. ORM handles database operations
4. Response returned as HTML or JSON
5. WebSocket server pushes notifications in real time
